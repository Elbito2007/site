				<h2>How did it come about and who did it?</h2>
				<hr class="linha"><br>
				The tyre, as we know it today, was not invented by a single person, but the result of an evolution over time. 
				The invention of solid rubber tire by Robert William Thomson in 1845 and the introduction of pneumatic rubber bicycle tire 
				by John Boyd Dunlop in 1888 were crucial steps in this evolution. With the emergence of motor vehicles, tire technology was
				 adapted to meet automotive needs, with significant contributions from various companies such as Michelin, which 
				 introduced radial tyres in 1946. Therefore, the modern tyre is the result of innovations from various inventors over time.
